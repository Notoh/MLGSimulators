# MLGSimulatorOtherLangs
Other language versions of MLG Simulator. 

## Some context

MLG Simulator was my first coding project ever. I wanted to make a math practice game to help me with learning how to program a calculator from scratch. I first did it in C++, and afterwards learned Java. Because of the similarities between Java and C#, I wanted to test out my knowledge. This is viewable at [MLG Simulator](https://github.com/notoh/mlgsimulator). Then a few months later, learning C I decided to do it [again](https://github.com/Notoh/mlgsimulatorc), making a version in every language I know as an exercise and a way to test out its features/compiler for each language, but made a centralized repo for them so I can keep them together.

Currently working on:
Ada
C++ (again as I need to redo it)
JavaScript
Maybe python
Maybe perl
